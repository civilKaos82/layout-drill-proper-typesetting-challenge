# Layout Drill Proper Typesetting 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 We're going to learn some fundamentals about styling elements on a web page.  You'll have a set of fixed HTML files to work with and your job is to change the CSS and *only* the CSS to achieve the desired effects.

The [source gist](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/dbfab8097733d67b8e5b) contains a set of files meant to represent a blog article that spans multiple pages.

If you open up any of the `page*.html` pages (the `*` represents any character), you'll find that they follow this format:

1. The name of the blog
2. A title for the article
3. The article body, broken up into sections
4. A very ugly pagination link area

If you haven't already read through it, make sure to peruse the  [Interactive Guide to Blog Typography](http://kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/).  A great resource.

## Learning Goals

- Fonts and typographic styling in CSS.
- CSS borders and colors.
- Margins and padding in CSS.

## Objectives

### Better Reading Through Typography

As closely as you can, edit the `main.css` file so that the text in each of the blog pages (`page*.html`) looks something like this:

You may not be able to pick out each of the differences, so in the interest of not wasting your time playing "compare the pictures", here is a list of the changes:

- Website header is separated from the rest of the page with a gray border
- Body copy uses a serif font while the header, title, pagination links, and footer use a sans-serif font
- Body copy is more readable due to improved spacing
- Blockquote copy is rendered in italics
- Headers within the blog article have more space above them than below them
